N people (numbered 1 to N) are standing in a circle. Person 1 kills Person 2 with a sword and gives it to Person 3. Person 3 kills Person 4 and gives the sword to Person 5. This process is repeated until only one person is alive. 

Task: 

(Medium) Given the number of people N, write a program to find the number of the person that stays alive at the end. 

(Hard) Show each step of the process.
